# Bikeshare Tableau Challenge

## Overview

This exercice takes a deep dive into Bikeshare data for New York City. We were able to create graphs to show when most bikes were checked out, checkout times and trips by gender and the top starting locations for shared bikes. This analysis offers us a chance to visualize a very large dataset to help us better understand it. 

## Results

* [Checkout Times for Users](LINK)

This chart the majority of the bikes were checked out for less than hour and the most of them were checked out for 5-6 minutes only. This tells us the bikes were mostly used for short commutes. 

* [Checkout Times by Gender](LINK)

Males were the most common users of bikes, followed by females and then followed by unknown gender, those that did not wish to share their gender. 

* [Trips by Weekday per Hour](LINK)

This chart shows that the busiest hours for bikesharing is during peak hour commutes, around 8 am in the morning and between 5-7 PM at night. We can also see that Thursday through Saturday have heavier bike usage. 

* [Trips by Gender (Weekday Per Hour)](LINK)

This chart shows the breakdown between bike usage between males, females and unknowns throughout the week. This chart mimics what was shown on the previous chart that busy hours are around 8 AM and 5-7 PM in the evening. As we already saw before, bikes were used by males predominantly, followed by females and unknowns. 


* [User Trips by Gender](LINK)

This chart breaks down usage between infrequent customers vs. subscribers, and subscriber usage is significantly more than customers. The weekday usage breakdown is the same to what we saw before in the previous two charts, with males being the predominant users and Thursday to Saturday see more trips than other days of the week. 


* [Top Starting Locations](LINK)

We overlayed the starting locations data on top of the map of New York City and the most popular starting locations are around Union Square, Murray Hill, Koreatown, West Village and so on, this also makes logical sense as these are popular tourist attractions. 


* [Bike Utilization](LINK)

This graph shows the utilization rate for each in the bikeshare system. The bigger the bubble, the more utilization of that bike. This is a great way to pin point which bikes are going to need service based on their utilization, and maybe move the less utilized bikes to locations with more traffic to even out utilization rates.
